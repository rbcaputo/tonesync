  /// These presets use maximum-depth amplitude modulation (0.9-1.0) with sine wave carriers
  /// to create isochronic-like pulses. True isochronic tones use square wave gating,
  /// but high-depth sine wave AM produces similar entrainment effects with less
  /// harmonic distortion and reduced listening fatigue.

  /// Isochronic tones are more intense than gentle brainwave AM and should be
  /// used for shorter sessions (10-20 minutes).
